    "Preprocessing (cleaning and transforming) your data is utterly essential to ML. Some would say that after defining interesting problems to solve (which isn't a modeling step), preprocessing (which isn't a modeling step) is the next most important part of ML projects. So I wanted to have a little bit on preprocessing on the website. But preprocessing is a MASSIVE topic, so this is only a small taste of what you can do. As always, the official docs are useful!\n",

[This article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-with-missing-data-in-pandas/) has examples too._\n",

    "2. Impute missing values (mean, median, mode, interpolation, deduction, mean-of-group, etc), \n",
