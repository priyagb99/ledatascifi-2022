    "- Predicting loan default, the data might include employee IDs for recent customer service contacts. But the most recent contact might be with trouble-loan specialists (because the firm anticipated possible default due to some other signal). Using that employee's customer contacts to predict default would add no value - the lender already knew to assign that employee!\n",
